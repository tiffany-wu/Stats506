## Problem 1 - Wine Data

### a. Import the data into a data.frame in R. Use the information in the “wine.names” file to give appropriate column names. (Note: Downloading and unzipping the file can take place outside of your submitted document, but importing the file should be in the submission.)

```{r}
rm(list = ls())

# Import wine data
wine <- read.csv("C:/Users/tiffa/University of Michigan Dropbox/Tiffany Wu/Tiffany Wu’s files/Documents/Stats506/PS1/wine.data")

# Rename columns using wine.names file
colnames(wine) <- c("Class", "Alcohol", "Malic_Acid", "Ash", "Alcalinity_of_Ash", 
                    "Magnesium", "Total_Phenols", "Flavanoids", "Nonflavanoid_Phenols", 
                    "Proanthocyanins", "Color_Intensity", "Hue", 
                    "OD280_OD315_Diluted_Wines", "Proline")
```


Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
